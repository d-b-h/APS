Binomial coefficients of an expression (a+b)^n may be generated by recursive method or by creating dynamic arrays. 
Consider query of nCk. 
Recursive method calls a recursive function binCoeff(n,k) which calls itself twice.
This leads to (2^n) + 1 function calls with (2^n -1)*8 bytes memory used.
A 2D dynamic array of size n*k with n*k*8 bytes memory used. Intermediate values of i<n, j<k stored.
A 1D dynamic array of max size k can be created where array is replaced in each iteration. 
Intermediate values of i<n, j<k not stored. *Least memory*
